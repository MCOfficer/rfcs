# Endless Sky RFCs

This repository is meant to contain proposals for large changes to the project
either through policy or code.

# What is an RFC

Request for comments (or RFC for short) is a document which serves to draft a
proposal to change code or community policy.  Accepted and rejected proposals
are both considered for merge because it helps future community understand the
mindset behind a proposal being accepted or rejected.

# What is still required?

- RFCs need a status.  For example, rejected, accepted, in progress.
